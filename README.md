This is a project to display some data cleaning work on an existing set of data. The data in question is the 2017 Halloween Candy Hierarchy, found here:

## Data Cleaning

The process of data cleaning was done so that a more accurate set could be potentially used. In the original data set, specific candies were columns with each individual surveyed creating a very large set of data. The project aims to consolidate the results of the survey and visualize the data while also removing non-candy items that the survey presented.

An additional set of data showing only candies that illicit a mean positive response is created.

## Data Visualization

To display the cleaned data set is usable, it is used to get some data visualization in the form of bar graphs. There are two graphs that show the reaction to all of the candies, both in alphabetical order and in ascending order by which candies are given the most positive reactions.
